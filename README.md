####Download the main xml file here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harshvardhanmalpani/Spam-List/master/filter_import_for_gmail.xml

Details at https://tutes.club/how-to-stop-spam-in-gmail-account-a-guide-to-creating-filters-in-google-mail/

`list.md` is the main spam list



`run.php` generates the file `filters.txt` to be used in gmail directly -- _*not really needed anymore -- use `xml.php`*_

`xml.php` generates the import file for gmail

javascript files contain codes which can be used to fetch all email address in present view in browser. I will add a walkthrough about it very soon.


##### Pull requests appreciated. I would love to add contributions and features(if needed).
