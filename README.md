# Spam-List
List of spamming domains and email addresses - for personal usage only

**Details**

`filters.txt` contains text which can be used to create filters in gmail. 
Details at https://tutes.club/how-to-stop-spam-in-gmail-account-a-guide-to-creating-filters-in-google-mail/

list.md is the main spam list

run.php generates the file filters.txt to be used in gmail directly

javascript files contain codes which can be used to fetch all email address in present view in browser. I will add a walkthrough about it very soon.

## To Do
I would like to see this working in full automatic mode. Eg- I will try to create a code which should be pasted in browser console and it will automatically clear all previous filters and create new filters in gmail without any human input. That would save a lot of time.

-- Pull requests appreciated. I would love to add contributions and features(if needed).
